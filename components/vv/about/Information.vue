      Most NGOs who provide help in the rural areas are focusing on vocational training, giving the local
      communities some abilities in order to them be able to create any product.
    </p>
    <p>
      he more clear example will be the growing farm part, where a lot of NGO’s collaborate to create fair-trade
      products,
      like coffee, tea, chocolate… but there is also the vocational training
      focused on manufacturing products, like bags, wallets, shoes, and traditional products from the local
      communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most powerful way to empower people is through education, and also giving vocational knowledge and training,
      but having presential training at every location is too cost-intensive to be realistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The software platform is a costless and effective way to escalate education and track the progress and the
      results in real-time.
